    <h3> A TCP Multi-Client Chat Application </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> C++</li>
      <li> TCP Socket programming in C++</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This simple program features a TCP server that allows multi-threaded connection of multiple clients at the same time. Each client can send to 
      and receive messages from other clients connected to the server. In simpler words, this is a simple demo program of a group chat room.
    </p>
    <p>I learned a lot about TCP socket programming by working on this project.</p>

    <h3> A Desktop Phonebook Application </h3>
    <h4> Featured Skills / Tools</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> C++</li>
      <li> Qt 5.14</li>
    </ul>
<p>
I built a desktop phonebook application to step up my networking game. Using this application, I can send personalized emails to all my contacts at the same time. 
I can launch a Skype call with any of my contacts at the click of a button, and I can keep track of important stuff like where they work and when they got their last promotion.

    <h3> A C++ std::vector Class </h3>

<p>
I implemented my own std::vector class to further understand data structures and algorithms. I called the class 'bucket' because I can't call it vector now, can I? :) Like all my other projects, I did it for learning and for fun.
