I built a desktop phonebook application to step up my networking game. Using this application, I can send personalized emails to all my contacts at the same time. 
I can launch a Skype call with any of my contacts at the click of a button, and I can keep track of important stuff like where they work and when they got their last promotion.

    <h3> 2. A TCP Multi-Client Chat Application </h3>
    <h4> Featured Skills / Tools</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> C++</li>
      <li> TCP Socket programming in C++</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This simple program features a TCP server that allows multi-threaded connection of multiple clients at the same time. Each client can send to 
      and receive messages from other clients connected to the server. In simpler words, this is a simple demo program of a group chat room.
    </p>
    <p>I learned a lot about TCP socket programming by working on this project.</p>

    <h3> 3. Weather Buddy - A Simple Weather App </h3>
    <h4> Featured Skills / Tools</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> C++</li>
      <li> Qt 5.14</li>
      <li> Accessing a public API</li>
      <li> Working with Json-formatted data in C++</li>
    </ul>
<p>
This simple weather application can get you the weather information of any city on earth. Just enter the city, select the country and click a button. That's it. 
It doesn't get any points for UI design, of course, but I'm working on that :) </p><p>I had lots of fun putting this application together, and I learned quite a lot as well. The biggest skills I learned working on this project are accessing a public API and accurately parsing chaos of data in Json format to a simple presentation that makes sense to the user.
Again, I marvel at just how robust Qt libraries are.</p>

    <h3> 4. A C++ std::vector Class </h3>

<p>
I implemented my own std::vector class to further understand data structures and algorithms. I called the class 'bucket' because I can't call it vector now, can I? :) Like all my other projects, I did this purely for learning and for fun, and I did learn a bucket load about data structures and algorithms from working on this class.
